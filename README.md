# YouTube Downloader GUI

## Description

I created this simple YouTube downloader GUI to address the constant requests from my relatives, who keep bothering me to download music from YouTube and similar platforms. Instead of manually running scripts, I decided to develop this tool to streamline the process.

## Usage Guide

To use this application, follow these steps:

1. **Install Required Libraries**: First, ensure you have all the necessary libraries and dependencies installed. You may need to install Python and various Python packages. For guidance on the required libraries, please refer to the script files.

2. **Compile the Scripts**: Compile the scripts in the way that best suits your environment. If you're unsure how to do this, consult online resources or seek assistance in the GPT chat. Please avoid reaching out to me directly for compilation issues.

3. **Download the Compiled Version**: If you prefer not to compile the scripts yourself, I've provided a pre-compiled version for your convenience. It's included in the repository.

4. **Usage**: The application offers a simple interface with two main buttons:
   - **Update and Download YT-DLP & FFmpeg**: This button updates the YouTube downloader and FFmpeg tools to their latest versions.
   - **Download Your Desired Content**: Use this button to initiate the download of the content you desire.
